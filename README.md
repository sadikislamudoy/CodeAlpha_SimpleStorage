🛠️ Task 1: Simple Storage Smart Contract
As per the internship instructions, this contract implements the following features:
State Variable: Declared an integer variable to store a value within the contract.
Increment Function: A public function that increases the stored value by 1.
Decrement Function: A public function that decreases the stored value by 1.
Visibility: The value is accessible from outside the contract, allowing for external reads.
Validation: The contract was compiled, deployed, and tested to ensure both increment and decrement logic work as expected.

🚀 Technical Stack
Language: Solidity 
IDE: Remix 
Platform: Ethereum 

📋 Instructions to Run
Copy the SimpleStorage.sol code from this repository.
Open Remix IDE.
Create a new file and paste the code.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract and use the provided buttons to test the increment and decrement functions.
